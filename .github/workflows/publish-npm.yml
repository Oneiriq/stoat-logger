name: Publish to npm

# This workflow publishes the package to npm automatically when code is merged to main.
#
# REQUIRED SECRET: NPM_TOKEN
# - This must be an npm Automation Token or Granular Access Token
# - The token MUST have the "Automation" setting enabled to bypass 2FA/OTP requirements
# - To create this token:
#   1. Log in to npmjs.com
#   2. Go to Account Settings > Access Tokens
#   3. Click "Generate New Token" > "Granular Access Token" (recommended)
#   4. Set permissions: Read and write access to the package
#   5. Enable "Automation" to bypass 2FA
#   6. Copy the token and add it to GitHub:
#      Repository Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret
#      Name: NPM_TOKEN
#      Value: <paste your token>
#
# Note: Classic tokens with "Automation" type also work, but Granular Access Tokens
# provide better security with more limited scope.
